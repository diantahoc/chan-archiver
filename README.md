ChanARCHIVER is an archive for 4chan. It has 3 operation modes:

1 - Full board archival. Archive all threads, and monitor board for new threads to archive.
2 - Single thread archival. Archive only a single thread until it 404. Useful for image dumping/info thread.
3 - Server mode. ChanARCHIVER runs as an HTTP server, serving only the archived threads. No archiving is made in this mode.

By default, ChanARCHIVER start the http server and archive /g/. You can modify it's behaviour with the following command line switches:

* `--thread:a:133` : Archive thread `133` from the /a/ board. This will start the single thread archival mode. No other thread can be archived.
* `--server` : Run ChanARCHIVER in the server mode.
* `--noserver` : To prevent ChanARCHIVER starting the HTTP server. Useful if you don't want to serve page right now, or another instance of ChanARCHIVER is running as server.
* `--board:r` : Archive the /r/ board.
